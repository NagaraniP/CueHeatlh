# mobile-engineer-ios-exercise-1
Basic Repository Structure for iOS created for use with Technical Challenge 

## App Task Description
You are a new hire for a clothing shop and your boss has entrusted you to keep track of how many shirts you sell during the day. \
He asks that you report these to him each day in a human-readable form by sending him your sales for the day via an email. \
He lets you know that you can find out the amount of product that is available by using the API Restful endpoint (https://us-west2-mobile-hiring.cloudfunctions.net/getInventory).


Cue wants to help you do this effectively so they have provided you a basic mobile application architecture that can consume and display the endpoints data. \
You can view the repository hosted on Cue’s Hiring Github  https://github.com/cuehealth-hiring/mobile-engineer-ios-exercise-1. \
To get started please fork this repository into your own personal Github account (Free if you don’t have one) for easy code submission (Fork a repo - GitHub Docs ).\
We ask when forking you make your repository public and as part of the submission you can share your repo URL.
